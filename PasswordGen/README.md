# üîê Random Password Generator (JavaScript)

This project is a **simple random password generator** built using plain JavaScript.  
It lets you customize your password by choosing:
- Lowercase letters  
- Uppercase letters  
- Numbers  
- Symbols  

and by setting your desired password length.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Character Sets

```js
const lowerCaseChars = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz";
const upperCaseChars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
const numberChars = "0123456789";
const symbolChars = "!@#$%^&*()_+-=";
```

These strings represent all possible characters that can appear in your password.

### 2. Allowed Characters

```js
allowedChars += includeLowerCase ? lowerCaseChars : "";
allowedChars += includeUpperCase ? upperCaseChars : "";
allowedChars += includeNumbers ? numberChars : "";
allowedChars += includeSymbols ? symbolChars : "";
```

Based on user choices (true/false), we build one string (`allowedChars`) that includes only the selected character types.

### 3. Validation Checks

```js
if (passwordLength < 8) {
  return "Password length must be at least 8!";
}
if (allowedChars.length === 0) {
  return "At least one set of characters must be selected";
}
```

We ensure the password is not too short and that at least one character set is selected.

### 4. Random Generation

```js
for (let i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
  const random = Math.floor(Math.random() * allowedChars.length);
  password += allowedChars[random];
}
```

- `Math.random()` gives a random decimal between 0 and 1.
- Multiplying it by `allowedChars.length` gives a random position in the string.
- `Math.floor()` removes the decimal part, turning it into a valid index.
- We use that index to pick a random character and add it to the password.

### 5. Return the Password

```js
return password;
```

After the loop ends, we return the final generated password.

## üß© Example Usage

```js
const password = generatePassword(
  12,    // password length
  true,  // include lowercase
  true,  // include uppercase
  true,  // include numbers
  false  // include symbols
);

console.log(password); // Example: "aK3mTfP9xGzQ"
```

## üí° Why This Structure?

This structure breaks the problem into logical steps:

1. Prepare all possible characters.
2. Filter based on user choices.
3. Validate input.
4. Randomly pick characters until the password is complete.

It's clean, modular, and easy to extend ‚Äî for example, you can later add options like excluding similar characters or ensuring at least one symbol.

## üß† Author's Note

This project was created as part of a JavaScript learning journey. It's a small but powerful exercise in understanding:

- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Random number generation
- String manipulation

Learning how this code is structured helps you think like a programmer ‚Äî breaking a big problem into smaller, logical steps.
